          <p>Java is popular high-level, class-based object oriented programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Currently Java is owned by Oracle and more than 3 billion devices run Java. Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. Java is used to develop Mobile apps, Web apps, Desktop apps, Games and much more.</p>
          <p>Java is very high in demand and all the major companies are recruiting Java Programmers to develop their Desktop, Web and Mobile applications.</p>
          <code>Java is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA). This means that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.</code>
          <ul>
            <li>Object Oriented - In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.</li>
          </ul>

        <section id='Javascript' class='main-section'>
          <header><h3>Javascript</h3></header>
          <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
          <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
          <code>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</code>
          <ul>
            <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
      
        <section id='HTML' class='main-section'>
          <header><h3>HTML</h3></header>
          <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup language used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wishes it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.</p>
          <p>However, plain text is limiting. Plain text files lack formatting elements like italics text, bold text, and titles. To add these elements, we can leverage HTML. HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the markup language used in all web browsers. And with a little extra effort, you can use HTML to write project documentation that can be read by everyone.</p>
          <code>Some tags define a block within the HTML document, while others are inline. For more information about block and inline elements, read my other article about a gentle introduction to HTML.</code>
          <ul>
            <li> Up/down/left/right to navigate to a specific square.</li>
          </ul>

        <section id='CSS' class='main-section'>
          <header><h3>CSS</h3></header>
          <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>
          <p>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.</p>
          <code>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages â€” for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</code>
          <ul>

        <section id='React' class='main-section'>
          <header><h3>React</h3></header>
          <p>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.</p>
          <p>If you're interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on CodePen, CodeSandbox, or Stackblitz.</p>
          <code>You can add React to an HTML page in one minute. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.
      
      </code>
          <ul>
            <li>When starting a React project, a simple HTML page with script tags might still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set up!</li>
